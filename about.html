                                <p> I am originally from Iran. I was born in Isfahan, one of the big and beautiful cities in
                                        Iran.I have been here in the United States for 8 months.I have been married since
                                        13 years ago. I immigrated to the United States because I think it is a very good
                                        opportunity for my kids to have a better life; however it is very difficult for me
                                        because I miss my family especially my mom & dad. I have two little kids; therefore,
                                        I am a busy mom. If I have time I love to read books , listen to music and walk along
                                        the beach.I love cooking and I think I am very good at cooking especially, Persian
                                        food. My goal for the future is to see my kids successful, improve my English and
                                        continue my education .</p>
                                <p> I’m a passionate, optimistic & dedicated woman who takes up responsibilities with utmost
                                        enthusiasm and see to it that I complete my tasks and assignments in time. I’ve a
                                        great amount of perseverance to achieve my goal. My optimistic and planned approach
                                        in things I do is what driving me towards my success. As how I strive for perfection
                                        in things, I expect the same from others as well. If things go out of control or
                                        go way out of track, I go an extra mile and contribute my efforts, in getting things
                                        done in time.
